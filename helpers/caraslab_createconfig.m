function caraslab_createconfig(Savedir,chanMap,sel, badchannels, fetch_tstart_from_behav, single_dir)
%
% This function sets configuration parameters for kilosort.
% 
% Input variables:
%   Savedir:
%       path to directory where -mat and -csv files will be saved
%
%   chanMap:
%       path to appropriate probe type's channel map
%
%   badchannels:
%       known bad/disconnected channels. These will still be sorted but will not
%       be used for CAR filter. For some mysterious reason to me, Kilosort
%       performs better when bad channels are included in the sorting
%
%   fetch_tstart_from_behav:
%       if 1, program will attempt to find a behavioral file within
%           Savedir/CSV files to grab the first relevant timestamp. This
%           helps eliminate noise from when the animal is plugged in
%           outside of the booth.
%           If Aversive is in the name of the folder, the first spout onset is
%           selected; if Aversive is not in the name of the folder, the first
%           stimulus onset is selected.
%       if 0, the entire recording ([0 Inf]) will be signalded to kilosort
%
%   sel:        
%       if 0 or omitted, program will cycle through all files
%           in the data directory. 
%                   
%       if 1, user will be prompted to select a file
